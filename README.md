# Loan_Prediction_Project
A machine learning model that will identify customers that are eligible for loan or not.

In this project, we built a machine learning model using a loan dataset to identify eligible customers for a loan. 

The project was carried out in several steps:

Load the dataset and the necessary Python packages.
Identify missing values and perform exploratory data analysis.
Preprocess the data by selecting the relevant features, transforming the columns as needed, and creating a pipeline to pass the state of the data to the next stage.

Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split method.

Fit the model using a relevant machine learning algorithm.

Evaluate the model on the training set to check for overfitting and underfitting, and fine-tune the model using hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance on the testing set.

Conclude the results and observations.

Dataset
The loan dataset used in this project contains information about customers and whether they were eligible for a loan or not. The dataset consists of 13 columns:

Loan_ID,
Gender,
Married,
Dependents,
Education,
Self_Employed,
ApplicantIncome,
CoapplicantIncome,
LoanAmount,
Loan_Amount_Term,
Credit_History,
Property_Area,
Loan_Status

Packages Used
The following Python packages were used in this project:

Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn

Conclusion

After building the machine learning model and evaluating its performance, we observed that the model had a high accuracy rate in predicting whether a customer was eligible for a loan or not. However, there is always room for improvement, and future work could focus on further fine-tuning the model or trying out different algorithms to improve its performance. Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in making data-driven decisions, such as determining eligibility for a loan.
